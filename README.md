**Kerberos Implementation**

This project implements the Kerberos authentication protocol, providing secure communication between clients, an authentication server, and message servers. Here's an overview of the key components:

* **Client:** Initiates authentication requests, sends messages to message servers, and receives messages.
* **Authentication Server (AS):** Verifies client identities, issues tickets, and grants access to message servers.
* **Message Server (MS):** Stores messages and validates client access using tickets.

**Project Structure:**

* **auth_server.py:** Implements the authentication server logic.
* **ms_server.py:** Implements the message server logic.
* **client.py:** Implements the client interaction and communication flow.
* **README.md:** This file (you're reading it now!).

**Dependencies:**

* Python 3
* `cryptography` library (install using `pip install cryptography`)

**Running the Project:**

1. **Configure Servers:**
   - Edit the `auth_server.py` and `ms_server.py` files to set appropriate ports (default: 1234 for AS, 1235 for MS).
   - Optionally, modify message server details in `ms_server.py` (IP, port, name, unique identifier, and symmetric key). These details should be consistent with the client configuration.

2. **Start Servers:**
   - Run `python auth_server.py` to start the authentication server.
   - Run `python ms_server.py` to start a message server. You may need to run multiple instances for multiple message servers.

3. **Client Registration:**
   - (Optional if no existing client information) Run `python client.py` to sign up a new client with the authentication server. Enter a username and password during the registration process. Client information is stored in the `me.info` file.

4. **Client Login and Communication:**
   - Run `python client.py` again.
   - Choose a message server to connect to from the available options.
   - Enter a message to send to the message server. The client will establish a secure connection and send the message.
   - You can continue sending messages or exit the client program.

**Key Functionalities:**

* **Client Signup:** Clients register with the authentication server, providing a username and password. The server creates a secret key for the client and stores it securely.
* **Authentication Flow:**  The client requests a ticket-granting ticket (TGT) from the AS using its username and password. The AS verifies the credentials, issues the TGT, and encrypts it with the client's secret key. The client then requests a service ticket for a specific message server from the AS using the TGT. The AS verifies the TGT, issues a service ticket encrypted with the message server's secret key, and sends it back to the client.
* **Secure Communication:** The client sends the service ticket along with an authenticator to the message server. The message server decrypts the service ticket using its secret key, verifies the client's identity and freshness of the ticket, and grants access to the client. Messages are encrypted with the session key established during the authentication flow.

**Additional Notes:**

* This implementation focuses on the core concepts of Kerberos and may not include advanced features like timestamp replay prevention.
* Error handling and logging can be further enhanced for a more robust solution.
* Consider using environment variables or configuration files to store server details for easier management.
