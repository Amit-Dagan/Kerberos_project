# Kerberos Implementation Project

This repository contains the implementation of a simplified version of the Kerberos authentication protocol as a part of a university project. The project is structured into several components, including the Authentication Server, Message Service Server, Client Application, and a script to demonstrate a dictionary attack on the protocol.

## Overview

The project simulates the Kerberos authentication mechanism allowing clients to securely communicate with services through an authentication server. It uses AES encryption for securing the communication channels.

### Components

1. **Auth Server**: The central authentication server responsible for registering users and services, and issuing tickets for secure communication.
2. **MSF Server (Message Service Server)**: A service that clients can communicate with after obtaining a valid ticket from the Auth Server.
3. **Client**: The client application that registers with the Auth Server, requests tickets for services, and communicates with the MSF Server using the tickets.
4. **Dictionary Attack Script**: A demonstration of how a dictionary attack could be performed against the protocol implementation to uncover user passwords.

### Files

- `auth_server.py`: The Authentication Server implementation.
- `msf_server.py`: The Message Service Server implementation.
- `client.py`: The client application that interacts with both the Auth Server and the MSF Server.
- `dictionary_attack.py`: A script demonstrating a dictionary attack on the protocol.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PyCryptodome library

## Setup

1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
2. Install the required PyCryptodome library:

```sh
pip install pycryptodome
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Running the Application
Start the Authentication Server:
sh
Copy code
python auth_server.py
In a new terminal, start the MSF Server:
sh
Copy code
python msf_server.py
In another terminal, run the Client application:
sh
Copy code
python client.py
To demonstrate the dictionary attack, ensure the Auth Server and MSF Server are running, and execute:
sh
Copy code
python dictionary_attack.py
